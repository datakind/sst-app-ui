                            DataKind may collect information about you at different stages and through various means. We try to collect as little data as necessary to provide our services. Some of it is optional, but allows us to continuously improve ourselves. We will only collect such data with your explicit consent. We will only collect and process your personal data where we have a lawful reason for its collection. Specifically, we collect information in the following ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                            <li>When you sign up on the website or one of our product websites, we may ask for information such as name, occupation, email address, etc.</li>
                            <li>If you subscribe to any of the digital platforms we use (mailing lists, team collaboration tools, etc.), we will collect information about your interaction with the services.</li>
                            <li>
                                If you apply to volunteer to work with us, we may interview you and keep track of your professional profile, skills etc.
                                In the course of your volunteering work with us, the output of your work may contain elements that describe you, e.g. pictures of you or notes that may refer to meetings and events you attended.                            </li>
                            <li>If you participate in a community event or webinar, we collect data you enter upon your registration, attendance status, and poll responses.</li>
                            <li>If you apply for a job at DataKind, we collect your resume, cover letter, and additional personal information. All information is securely kept in our Applicant Tracking System, Greenhouse.</li>

It may also be processed by staff and volunteers operating outside the EEA. Such personnel may be engaged in statistical analysis of your data and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

                            The information that we have collected about you will be stored on DataKind-owned or third party servers and, on occasions, on the local machines of staff and volunteers. As a remote-first organization, we process data in a variety of locations across the United States, United Kingdom, Kenya, Canada, and other locations. We rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders, such as contracts incorporating data protection and sharing obligations. We provide the capability for the return, transfer, and/or disposal of personal data in a secure manner. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

We have implemented best-practice standards and controls in compliance with internationally recognized security frameworks. We use encryption technologies to protect data at rest and in transit.
